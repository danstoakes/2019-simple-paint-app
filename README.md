# YoutubePaintApp

This is the original Paint application which was written to accompany the "How to Make a Paint App" series available <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1sWSxMsdTWP17fdJqt72sM82qlQWjzjl">here</a>.

Since its release, it has now been replaced by a more up-to-date version available <a href="https://github.com/danstoakes/SimplePaintApp">here</a>. This version features a custom colour picker, saving, sharing, etc, and builds upon many of the issues with the original. I highly recommend using this version, rather than the original.

## Installation

Simply load via Android Studio or another similar IDE.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

It is worth noting that this is a legacy-style archive, and likely won't be updated. The best option would be to use the newer version (see above).
